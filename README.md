# Sanitized Dump

Default public. This file contains the embryo of a blog. Please be nice. 

What do you do with ideas you dont have the time, energy or money to pursue? What if it could be someone else's spark? Can logging interesting links also be helpful? This is a non-sorted list of  heterogenous items that may or may not include the above.

Machine-Learning non english accent correction filter. I watched a [Call to Spy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Call_to_Spy) last night. Nice film. I'm a native french speaker. A couple third roles were played by english speakers with accents, probably due to filming location. When there's budget to source 1940s vehicles, shouldn't there be a filter that costs a few grands to run to dub third roles with a morphed track of their own voices to make their accent believable?

Default Private. Maybe the unease we are experiencing stems from this gray zone weâ€™ve now created between what has been public and vetted and private and un-filtered. Could this be what gave the mic to people that cause confusion? Can we put the cat back in the bag? Or burn the bag? How about everything published becomes fully public, and the platforms are fully accountable? Maybe this is what is happening?
